Checker Framework Demo
======================

This repository demonstrates how to use the Checker Framework to check
various properties of Java code. The `tests/` repository includes test
programs to demonstrate the various built-in Java Checkers, while the
`divbyzero` directory demonstrates a rudimentary checker to guard
against division-by-zero errors.
